# Scene of Lights

A 3D scene with dynamic day-night cycle where the sun orbits the landscape, controlling light intensity and shadows while street lamps automatically illuminate at night.

## üìã Technical Requirements

1. Add a plane (floor) that will receive shadows
2. Add a house model to the scene
3. Add a street lamp model that will emit a SpotLight
4. Add a lamp model that will emit a PointLight
5. Add a yellow sphere that will behave like the sun:
   - It will rotate around the scene
   - It will emit a DirectionalLight
   - When the sun is at its highest point - maximum light intensity
   - When it sets below the horizon - minimum intensity
6. Add an AmbientLight that will synchronously change its intensity with the DirectionalLight
7. SpotLight and PointLight will turn on when the DirectionalLight sets below the horizon
8. All objects must cast shadows on the ground
